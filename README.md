This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app allows users to play a classic web based memory game. The game contains a 3 x 3 grid of squares which light up in a sequence, the players must remember and then repeat this sequence to score a point. The goal of this project was to demonstrate my background in software development, with a bigger focus on logical programming then a regular react app. You can try this app out at: portfolio link here.
